1. Implement Bubble sort( 2 approaches). Performance ?.. Can you improve it ?
2. Implements QuickSort (2 approaches = iterative + recursiv) [Look up 3way Quicksort]. Performance..?

=> [Explain me  how each sort type is working + complexity] + mergeSort + BST + insertionSort + selection Sort.

4. Implement a linkedList locally.

=>[Explain me List vs Set vs Map]
LinkedList vs ArrayList vs DoubleLinked Listvs Set vs HashSet vs TreeSet vs HashMap vs OrderedMap

		(Order by joined Date and name)
7. Things I have in common with someone. What things are only mine (Two external files).
8. Given an CSV file map it to Java Objects .
9. Middle element of a list (2 solutions). Find optimal solution O(n) => one traversal.
10. Split and joit arrays and linkedlist from external files
	Ex input file1.txt
		1,2,3
		4,5,6
		
	File2.txt
		...
		 + preety print me the result
